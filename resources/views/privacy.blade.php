    The data listed above is collected through the use of server log files and tracking technologies, as detailed in the “Cookies and Data Collection Tools” section below. It is stored by us and associated with your account.
    <h4>2. How We Get Data About You</h4>
    We use tools like cookies, web beacons, analytics services and advertising providers to gather the data listed above. Some of these tools offer you the ability to opt out of data collection.
    <h4>2.1 Cookies and Data Collection Tools</h4>
    As detailed in our Cookie Policy, Yellow Alley and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third party advertisers) use server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints and web beacons (together, <strong>“Data Collection Tools”</strong>) when you access and use the Services. These Data Collection Tools automatically track and collect certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered through those Data Collection Tools to other data that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
    We use cookies (small files that websites send to your device to uniquely identify your browser or device or to store data in your browser) for things like analysing your use of the Services, personalizing your experience, making it easier to log into the Services and recognizing you when you return. We use web beacons (small objects that allow us to measure the actions of visitors and users using the Services) for things like identifying whether a page was visited, identifying whether an email was opened, and advertising more efficiently by excluding current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new mobile app download.<br><br>
    Yellow Alley uses the following types of cookies:<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li><u><strong>Preferences:</strong></u> Cookies that remember data about your browser and preferred settings that affect the appearance and behaviour of the Services (like your preferred language).</li>
    <li><u><strong>Security:</strong></u> Cookies used to enable you to log in and access the Services; protect against fraudulent logins; and help detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use of your account.</li>
    <li><u><strong>Functional:</strong></u> Cookies that store functional settings (like the volume level you set for video playback).</li>
    <li><u><strong>Session State:</strong></u> Cookies that track your interactions with the Services to help us improve the Services and your browsing experience, remember your login details, and enable processing of your course purchases. These are strictly necessary for the Services to work properly, so if you disable them then certain functionalities will break or be unavailable.</li>
    </ul>
    You can set your web browser to alert you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, limit the types of cookies you allow or refuse cookies altogether. If you do, you may not be able to use some or all features of the Services and your experience may be different or less functional.<br><br>
    Some of the third-party partners who provide certain features on our site may also use Local Storage Objects (also known as flash cookies or LSOs) to collect and store data.
    <h4>2.2 Analytics</h4>
    We use third-party browser and mobile analytics services like Google Analytics on the Services. These services use Data Collection Tools to help us analyse your use of the Services, including information like the third-party website you arrive from, how often you visit, events within the Services, usage and performance data and where the application was downloaded from. We use this data to improve the Services, better understand how the Services perform on different devices and provide information that may be of interest to you.
    <h4>2.3 Online Advertising</h4>
    We use third-party advertising services and ad servers to deliver advertising about our Services on other websites and applications you use. The ads may be based on things we know about you, like your Usage Data and System Data (as detailed in Section 1), and things that these ad service providers know about you based on their tracking data. The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity over time and across other sites and services and may be tailored to your interests.<br><br>
    Depending on the types of advertising services we use, they may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, phone or other device to collect data about your use of our Services and may access those tracking technologies in order to serve these tailored advertisements to you. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may provide these service providers with a hashed, anonymized version of your email address (in a non-human-readable form) and content that you share publicly on the Services.<br><br>
    When using mobile applications you may also receive tailored in-app advertisements. Apple iOS, Android OS, and Microsoft Windows each provide their own instructions on how to control in-app tailored advertising. For other devices and operating systems, you should review your privacy settings or contact your platform operator.
    <h4>3. What We Use Your Data For</h4>

    <h4>4. Who We Share Your Data With</h4>

    We share certain data about you with instructors, other students, companies performing services for us, our business partners, analytics and data enrichment providers, your social media providers, companies helping us run promotions and surveys and advertising companies who help us promote our Services. We may also share your data as needed for security, legal compliance or as part of a corporate restructuring. Lastly, we can share data in other ways if it is aggregated or de-identified or if we get your consent.<br><br>

    We may share your data with third parties under the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li><u>With Instructors:</u> We share data that we have about you with teaching assistants for courses you enrol in or request information about, so they can improve their courses for you and other students. We do not share your email address with teaching assistants. We also enable our instructors to implement Google Analytics on their course pages to track sources of traffic to their courses and optimize their course pages.</li>
    <li><u>With Service Providers, Contractors and Agents:</u> We share your data with third-party companies who perform services on our behalf, like payment processing, data analysis, marketing and advertising services (including retargeted advertising), email and hosting services, customer services and support. These service providers may access your personal data and are required to use it solely as we direct, to provide our requested service.</li>
    <li><u>With Business Partners:</u> We have agreements with other websites and platforms to distribute our Services and drive traffic to Yellow Alley. Depending on your location, we may share your data with these partners.</li>
    <li><u>With Analytics and Data Enrichment Services:</u> As part of our use of third-party analytics tools and data enrichment services, we share certain contact information, Account Data, System Data, Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1), or de-identified data as needed. De-identified data means data where we’ve removed things like your name and email address and replaced it with a token ID. This allows these providers to provide analytics services or match your data with publicly-available database information. We do this to communicate with you in a more effective and customized manner.</li>
    <li><u>To Power Social Media Features:</u> The social media features in the Services may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things like your IP address and which page of the Services you’re visiting and to set a cookie to enable the feature. Your interactions with these features are governed by the third-party company’s privacy policy.</li>
    <li><u>For Advertising:</u> If we decide to offer advertising in the future, we may use and share certain System Data and Usage Data with third-party advertisers and networks to show general demographic and preference information among our users. We may also allow advertisers to collect System Data through Data Collection Tools (as detailed in Section 2.1), and to use this data to offer you targeted ad delivery to personalize your user experience (through behavioural advertising) and undertake web analytics. Advertisers may also share with us the data they collect about you. To learn more or opt out from participating ad networks’ behavioural advertising, see Section 6.1 (Your Choices About the Use of Your Data) below. Note that if you opt out, you’ll continue to be served generic ads.</li>
    <li><u>For Security and Legal Compliance:</u> We may disclose your data to third parties if we (in our sole discretion) have a good faith belief that the disclosure is:</li><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Permitted or required by law;</li>
    <li>Requested as part of a judicial, governmental, or legal inquiry, order, or proceeding;</li>
    <li>Reasonably necessary as part of a valid subpoena, warrant, or other legally-valid request;</li>
    <li>Reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other legal agreements;</li>
    <li>Required to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, misuse, potential violations of law (or rule or regulation), or security or technical issues; or</li>
    <li>Reasonably necessary in our discretion to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of Yellow Alley, our users, employees, members of the public, or our Services.</li>
    <li> may also disclose data about you to our auditors and legal advisors in order to assess our disclosure obligations and rights under this Privacy Policy.</li></ul>
    <li><u>During a Change in Control:</u> If Yellow Alley undergoes a business transaction like a merger, acquisition, corporate divestiture, or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of all or some of its assets, we may share, disclose, or transfer all of your data to the successor organization during such transition or in contemplation of a transition (including during due diligence).</li>
    <li><u>After Aggregation/De-identification:</u> we can disclose or use aggregate or de-identified data for any purpose.</li>
            <li><u>With Your Permission:</u> with your consent, we may share data to third parties outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <h4>5. Security</h4>

    We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of data being stored. As with any internet-enabled system, there is always a risk of unauthorized access, so it’s important to protect your password and to contact us if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account.<br><br>

    Yellow Alley takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data that we collect and store. These measures vary based on the type and sensitivity of the data. Unfortunately, however, no system can be 100% secured, so we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Yellow Alley, the Services, or any information provided to us in connection with the data we collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Your password & Mobile Number is an important part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it. You should not share your password or Mobile Number with any third party, and if you believe your password or account has been compromised, you should change it immediately and contact support@yellowalley.org with any concerns.

        <h4>6. Your Rights</h4>

    You have certain rights around the use of your data, including the ability to opt out of promotional emails, cookies and collection of your data by certain analytics providers. You can update or terminate your account from within our Services and can also contact us for individual rights requests about your personal data.
        <h4>6.1 Your Choices About the Use of Your Data</h4>
    You can choose not to provide certain data to us, but you may not be able to use certain features of the Services.
        <ul>
            <li>To stop receiving promotional communications from us, you can opt out by using the unsubscribe mechanism in the promotional communication you receive or by changing the email preferences in your account. Note that regardless of your email preference settings, we will send you transactional and relationship messages regarding the Services, including administrative confirmations, important updates about the Services and notices about our policies.</li>
            <li>The browser or device you use may allow you to control cookies and other types of local data storage. Your wireless device may also allow you to control whether location or other data is collected and shared.</li>
            <li>To get information and control cookies used for tailored advertising from participating companies, see the consumer opt-out pages for the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising platforms.</li></ul>
    If you have any questions about your data, our use of it, or your rights, contact us at info@yellowalley.org.
        <h4>6.2 Accessing, Updating and Deleting Your Personal Data</h4>
    You can access and update your personal data that Yellow Alley collects and maintains as follows:
    To update data you provide directly, log into your account and update your account at any time.
    Please note that we retain certain data where we have a lawful basis to do so, including for mandatory record-keeping and to complete transactions.
        <h4>6.3 Our Policy Concerning Children</h4>
    We recognize the privacy interests of children and encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. Children under 13 should not use the Services. If we learn that we’ve collected personal data from a child under those age, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.<br><br>
    Parents who believe that Yellow Alley may have collected personal data from a child under those ages can submit a request that it be removed to info@yellowalley.org.
        <h4> 7. Jurisdiction-Specific Rules</h4>

    Since the internet industry is still working on Do Not Track standards, solutions and implementations, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals.
    By visiting or using our Services, you consent to storage of your data on servers located in India.
        <h4>8. Updates & Contact Info</h4>

    When we make a material change to this policy, we’ll notify users via in-product notice or another mechanism required by law. Changes become effective the day they’re posted. Please contact us via email with any questions, concerns or disputes.
        <h4>8.1 Modifications to This Privacy Policy</h4>
    From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. If we make any material change to it, we will notify you through a notification posted on the Services, or as required by applicable law. We will also include a summary of the key changes. Unless stated otherwise, modifications will become effective on the day they are posted.<br><br>
    As permitted by applicable law, if you continue to use the Services after the effective date of any change, then your access and/or use will be deemed an acceptance of (and agreement to follow and be bound by) the revised Privacy Policy. The revised Privacy Policy supersedes all previous Privacy Policies.

    If you have any questions, concerns or disputes regarding our Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact our privacy team at info@yellowalley.org.
        <h4>Cookie Policy</h4>
    This Cookie Policy was last updated on January 1, 2020
        <h4>What are cookies?</h4>
    Cookies are small text files stored by your browser as you browse the internet. They can be used to collect, store and share data about your activities across websites, including on Yellow Alley. Cookies also allow us to remember things about your visits to Yellow Alley, like your preferred language and to make the site easier to use.<br><br>
    We use both session cookies, which expire after a short time or when you close your browser and persistent cookies, which remain stored in your browser for a set period of time. We use session cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, like when you log into Yellow Alley. We use persistent cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period.
        <h4>Why does Yellow Alley use cookies and similar technologies?</h4>
    We use cookies and similar technologies like web beacons, pixel tags, or local shared objects (“flash cookies”), to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways. We use these cookies both when you visit our site and services through a browser and through our mobile app. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional data through other methods.<br><br>
    We use cookies for the following purposes:
        <br><br>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Authentication and security</strong></td>
                    <td>To log you into Yellow Alley<br>
                    To protect your security<br>
                    To help detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate Yellow Alley’s agreements</td>
            </tr>
        </table><br>

    For example, cookies help authenticate your access to Yellow Alley and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your accounts.<br><br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Preferences</strong></td>
                <td>To remember data about your browser and your preferences<br>
                    To remember your settings and other choices you’ve made</td>
            </tr>
        </table><br>
    For example, cookies help us remember your last watched session, so we can provide further content without asking each time you visit.<br><br>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><strong> Analytics and research</strong></td>
                <td>To help us improve and understand how people use Yellow Alley</td>
            </tr>
        </table><br>

    For example, cookies help us test different versions of Yellow Alley to see which features or content users prefer, web beacons help us determine which links are opened and cookies help us see how you interact with Yellow Alley, like the links you click on.<br><br>
    We also work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics who use cookies and similar technologies to help us analyse how users use the Services, including by noting the sites from which you arrive. Those service providers may either collect that data themselves or we may disclose it to them.<br><br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Personalized content</strong></td>
                <td>To customize Yellow Alley with more relevant content</td>
            </tr>
        </table><br>
    For example, cookies help us show a personalized list of recommended courses on the homepage.<br><br>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><strong> Advertising</strong></td>
